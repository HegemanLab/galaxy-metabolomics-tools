All tool lists are formatted for [Ephemeris](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris).

- `tool_list.yaml` are metabolomics tools organized by label
- `tool_list.yaml.lock` same as `tool_list.yaml`, but with all versions being used in the lab
- `tool_list-label_metabolomics.yaml*` same as above, but with all labels set to "metabolomics"
