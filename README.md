Tools used by the Hegeman Lab's Galaxy server.

All tool lists are formatted for [Ephemeris](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris).

Also see tool list from [W4M](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/w4m-config/blob/latest/tool_list.yaml) and [UseGalaxy.eu](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/usegalaxy-eu-tools/blob/master/metabolomics.yaml).

## Files:

- `tool_list.yaml` are metabolomics tools organized by label
- `tool_list.yaml.lock` same as `tool_list.yaml`, but with all tool versions being used in the lab
- `tool_list-label_metabolomics.yaml*` same as above, but with all labels set to "metabolomics"
